Test. This is a relatively long text block that only exists
to show how this paragraph will be layed out with respect to 
the graphic below.
\begin{center}
\input{/tmp/test1.tikz}
\end{center}
Also there should be some text below. This text block
should also be a not too short, so that there will be a line
break within the paragraph.
